			<p>A front-end developer (or a UI developer) takes website designs (artwork) usually in Photoshop or Illustrator and converts that artwork into HTML templates using CSS and JavaScript. Front-end development work is just one part of the process; other parts include back-end development, <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr>, Planning and Project Management and that's just for starters.</p>

			<h2 class="h h2">What’s with the yellow?</h2>
			<p>The short answer is because Phil <del>likes</del> loves it; the longer answer is that it makes the website stand-out. It allows for a very simplistic, some may say, minimalist design that maintains some character.</p>			
			<p>Some people like the yellow and some don’t.</p>
