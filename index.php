						<p>Phil was an excellent front end developer to work with. He’s the hard-to-find type of person who pays close attention to every detail, and was willing to continually tweak spacing and interactions until the site felt as close to perfect as possible. Although we were working in different time zones, we had almost daily Skype conversations about how things were turning out and how to continually improve the site. He worked diligently to meet our design standards and functionality while also keeping the site running smoothly, given the pages complex interactions.</p>

			<h2 class="h h2">What’s with the yellow?</h2>
			<p>The short answer is because Phil likes loves it; the longer answer is that it makes the website stand-out. It allows for a very simplistic, some may say, minimalist design that maintains some character.</p>			
			<p>Some people like the yellow and some don’t.</p>
