These repo exists publicly so that any agencies/start-ups can see the quality of the front-end code produced by the front-end freelancer, Phil Thompson.

The build process requires, Node, NPM and Grunt in order to create the production-ready front-end code.

## Setup
`cd _grunt`
`npm install`
`npm install grunt-postcss autoprefixer cssnano`

## Run
`grunt watch`


## Basics

if you are new to front-end tooling you may not have Node/NPM/Grunt so here are some helpful links:

Installing Node:
https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node

Installing Grunt:
http://gruntjs.com/installing-grunt

### Weird stuff
NPM on a mac is sometimes a bit odd with permissions issues and the instructions here are helpful:
https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions

### Alternatives
Other than Grunt there are other tools
* Gulp
* Browersify
* Webpack

All do similar and yet different things so go research them all and pick the one best for you.
